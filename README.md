### Project Description
HYACINTH is an AI-powered resume analyzer that extracts text from PDF resumes and provides intelligent insights to help job seekers improve their profiles. It uses Gemini API to analyze the content against job descriptions.

### The Problem statement
Job seekers often struggle to tailor their resumes for specific roles, and manual review is time-consuming. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) can filter out good candidates due to formatting or keyword mismatches.

### The Solution
We provide a tool that parses PDF resumes, extracts text, and uses AI to analyze strengths, weaknesses, and keyword matches, offering actionable feedback to increase the chances of getting shortlisted.

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

**Tool Used:** [e.g., GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude]

**Purpose:** [What you used it for]
- Example: "Generated boilerplate React components"
- Example: "Debugging assistance for async functions"
- Example: "Code review and optimization suggestions"

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
